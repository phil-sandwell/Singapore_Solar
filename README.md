# Solar deployment in Singapore

## Overview

Singapore, a highly-urbanised city-state in South East Asia, has the goal of deploying 2 GWp (2,000,000 kWp) of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity by 2030. Sitting close to the equator, Singapore receives a high level of solar irradiance - around 1,600 kWh per square metre per year - which makes solar PV an obvious choice to contribute to its renewable energy goals. PV module prices fell 86% between 2010 and 2018 and, with costs continuing to decrease, solar offers an alternative electricity source competitive with, or lower than, the tariffs of the national grid.

In this project I took a (very brief!) look into the status of solar PV deployment in Singapore. As well as learning more about deployment in the country, it also let me explore some interesting real-life data and gave me an excuse to practice some geographic and web-based visualisations which don't often come up in my usual projects. All of the code used in this project is available in the GitHub repository.
